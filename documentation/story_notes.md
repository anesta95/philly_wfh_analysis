Story idea: Do workers in the Philly area really work from home more or go into the office less than other places?

Data sources:
* [Kastle Back To Work Barometer](https://www.kastle.com/safety-wellness/getting-america-back-to-work/)
* [WFH Research](https://wfhresearch.com/)
* [Census ACS 2022 5-Year estimates](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT5Y2022.B08006) can be done at the tract level for Philly & surrounding counties.
* [CPS Microdata for Philly & country as a whole by NAICS supersector](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/)

According to Census '22' ACS data, it doesn't look like Philly worked from home more often than other cities in the Kastle dataset. Why might that be?

Create WFH time series with the same 10 metros with CPS microdata.

Do a percentage working from home & percentage of total workforce by NAICS supersector for Philly and country at large with CPS microdata.

Do a percentage of BLS supersector of total workforce for Philly, Dallas, New York, Chicago and US dot plot.

Two factors might be at play: 
1. Do Philly "office workers", i.e. workers in white-collar industries who are more likely to be able to WFH working from home at a higher rate than their contemporaries in other metros?
2. Does Philly have comparatively _fewer_ "office workers" and thus the Kastle data is representing an outsized proportion of them?

Do a PUMA map of Philly MSA WFH percentage.
